# Pocket GM — Baseball

Single-file baseball **GM simulation** game (inspired by the iOS *Pocket GM Football/Basketball* apps).
You run the front office of a fictional 30-team baseball league: roster, lineup/rotation, season
sim, trades, free agency, amateur draft, contracts/budget, playoffs, and a multi-season franchise loop.

## Run it
- It's a single static file: `index.html`. Open it directly in a browser, or serve the folder:
  `python3 -m http.server 8124 --directory ~/baseball-gm` → http://localhost:8124
- Registered in `~/.claude/launch.json` as **baseball-gm** (port 8124) for the preview tooling.
- No build step. React 18 + Babel-standalone + Tailwind, all via CDN.

## Architecture (all in `index.html`)
- **Bootstrap:** the app code lives in a `<script type="text/babel-src" id="app-src">` block. A small
  inline `<script>` at the bottom does `Babel.transform(src, {presets:[["react",{runtime:"classic"}]]})`
  then `eval`s it. The explicit **classic** runtime is required — the default `react` preset emits an
  ESM `import` (automatic JSX runtime) which breaks in a non-module inline script.
- **State:** one big `G` object held in `App` `useState`, persisted to `localStorage`
  (`pocketgm_baseball_v1`) via `commit()`. New game built by `newGame(userTeamId)`.
  - `G.players` is an **object dict keyed by id** (not an array). Use `Object.values(G.players)` or the
    `rosterOf(G, teamId)` helper. `autoSetLineups` accepts either an array or the dict.
- **Sim engine:** `simGame()` runs a real inning-by-inning, plate-appearance model. `paOutcome()`
  converts batter vs. pitcher ratings into K/BB/HR/hit/out probabilities; `advance()` moves baserunners.
  Produces realistic season stat lines (≈ .350 AVG / 50 HR / sub-2 ERA leaders).
- **Season:** `buildSchedule()` = circle-method round-robin repeated to 162 games (15 games/day).
  `simDay()` advances one day; at day 162 `enterPlayoffs()` fires.
- **Postseason:** 6 seeds/league, Wild Card Bo3 → Division Bo5 → LCS Bo7 → World Series Bo7.
- **Offseason loop:** aging/development toward potential + decline, retirements, contract expiry →
  free agency, `buildDraft()` (5-round amateur draft), then `startNewSeason()` rolls everything over.

## Player model
- Hitters rated CON/POW/EYE/SPD/DEF; pitchers STU/CTL/STM. `computeOvr()` derives OVR; `pot` is ceiling.
- `salaryFor()` scales salary by OVR + age (pre-arb discount). `playerValue()` drives trade/FA AI.

## Gotchas / tuning ideas
- Win leader can reach ~25 (a touch high) — tune `awardDecision()` / rotation depth if desired.
- After an auto-simmed offseason the user roster can dip into the low 20s; fill via Free Agency.
- AI trade acceptance: accepts if value received ≥ 0.97× value given (`Trades` component).
